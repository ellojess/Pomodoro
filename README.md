### About The Pomodoro Technique
Typically the Pomodoro technique requires some level of manual labor in which you: 
- Choose a task to work on.
- Put away all distractions â€” turn off the notifications on your email, put your phone in a drawer, turn off the TV, and tell your family that you need some focus time.
- Set a timer for 25 minutes, and work until the timer goes off.
- Take a five-minute break (again, set the timer).

This handy mobile app eliminates the need for that kind of manual labor, simply setup the app on your mobile device and press "Start" whenever you're ready
